<p>Geometric modeling kernels play an important role in modern CAD systems. They are the core of modern CAD systems, providing geometric modeling algorithms, and base classes to store and implement constructive solid geometry objects. Without them, modern CAD applications most likely would not exist in their current state.</p>

<p>However, current geometric modeling kernels are heavily CPU based, and currently are not optimized for parallel processing even on CPUs. The algorithms implemented in these systems are commonly implemented in parallel for performance benefits, but lack support for GPUs, the parallel nature of which would give large performance boosts to these algorithms.</p>

<p>As well, current CAD systems are for the most part platform dependent, usually depending on Windows. This dependency on closed source software makes it hard to improve the current state of the arts performance because of this lack of accessibility to the geometric algorithms source code.</p>

<p>gpgmk is, to the best of my knowledge, the first geometric modeling kernel to offer GPU support for CAD algorithms.</p>

<a id="project-goals" class="anchor" href="#project-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Goals</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to implement a set of standard CAD algorithms, including filleting/rounding, chamfering, extrude, rotate, loft, sweep, union, difference, and, or, and xor.  These algorithms should be implemented with as much GPU support as possible, in order to gain the most performance from GPU utilization as possible.</p>

<p>Visualization functionality should also be provided, so that the results of these operations can be visually verified and checked against other CAD systems.</p>

<p>As well, these functions should be implemented in as cross platform manner, using cross platform technologies, so that the largest number of people can take advantage of the generated product.</p>

<p>In short, the major goals of this project can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a standard set of CAD algorithms.</li>
<li>Add GPU support wherever feasible to increase performance.</li>
<li>Use cross platform technologies wherever possible, to increase the portability of geometric modeling kernels.</li>
<li>Provide visualization support, so results can be visually verified.</li>
</ul>
